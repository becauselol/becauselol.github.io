Hi I'm Gabriel, currently a 3rd year undergraduate student studying Engineering Systems and Design at [SUTD](https://sutd.edu.sg). I like to learn about Operations Research, topics like Linear Optimization, Probability and Statistics as well as Machine Learning keep me going in life. Algorithms and Competitive Programming are also things that I am currently loving. Looking to keep going and keep studying as life goes on.
